In this project, I focused on implementing and testing a Q-learning algorithm to train an agent to navigate a maze. The provided code included foundational components such as the maze setup, visualization functions, and a general framework for reinforcement learning. Specifically, the following were given:

Maze environment: Functions to define and visualize the maze grid.
Model architecture: A predefined method for constructing the neural network model.
Training loop structure: A basic framework for iterating over episodes to train the model.
I contributed by working primarily on the Q-learning algorithm cell. This involved:

Defining the Q-learning process: Implementing the logic for how the agent explores the environment, updates Q-values, and learns optimal policies.
Training the agent: Modifying and running the qtrain() function to improve the model's performance, including setting parameters like the number of epochs, memory size, and data sampling rate.
Debugging and visualization: Ensuring that the Q-learning algorithm was functioning correctly by visualizing the maze and agent's progress after training.

When approaching a problem, computer scientists use a structured methodology: defining the problem clearly, breaking it into manageable components, designing and implementing a solution, and rigorously testing the results. This iterative process emphasizes logical reasoning, creativity, and adaptability to ensure that the solution is robust and efficient. Ethical responsibilities are central to this work, requiring computer scientists to safeguard user privacy, eliminate biases, and design systems that are transparent and accessible. At the organizational level, they must maintain integrity, ensure compliance, and build solutions that are sustainable and scalable. By balancing technical expertise with ethical accountability, computer scientists create technology that is both impactful and trustworthy.
